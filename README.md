# Tagcloud Plugin for reveal.js

Simple Tag-Cloud Plugin for [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) (framework for easily creating beautiful presentations using HTML) - [![MIT license][license-img]][license-url]

Version 1.1.0

![Tag Cloud](https://www.plus-innovations.com/images/tagcloud.jpg)

## Installation

Place the `tagcloud`-directory within the reveal.js `plugin` directory - that's it. Tested with version 3.1 of [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)

## Usage

With this plugin, you easily can create tagclouds within reveal.js - eather coloured or black&white. 

After copying the 'tagcloud' directory into the reveal.js 'plugin' directors, you also need to add this dependency to your Reveal.initialize script (which you will normaly find at the end of your HTML file).

```html
<script>
    Reveal.initialize({

        // ... add your settings here ...

        // Optional reveal.js plugins
        dependencies: [
            // other dependencies ...

            // add THIS dependency for tagcloud plugin
            { src: 'plugin/tagcloud/tagcloud.js', async: true } 

        ]
    });

</script>

```

After that, in the slides-section of your HTML, just create a section for your next slide. Add a `tagcloud` attribute to your section. Insite the section each item gets a seperate line. In your presentation place e.g. the following code:

```html
<section tagcloud>
    Twitter Bootstrap
    jQuery
    less
    GruntJS
    JSHint
    JSLint
    markdown
    sass
    jade
    coffeescript
    codekit
    livereload
    web-build
    jQuery UI
    mustache
    emmet.io
    bower
    browserstack
    npm
    RequireJS
    socket.io
    jQuery Mobile
    node.js
    Jasmine
 </section>
```

For a black&white tag cloud you can do the same, by just adding a `bw` attribute:

![Tag Cloud](https://www.plus-innovations.com/images/tagcloud-bw.jpg)


```html
<section tagcloud bw>
    Twitter Bootstrap
    jQuery
    less
    ...
    ...
    Jasmine
 </section>
```

If you want your items to appear a little larger, add the `large` attribute:

```html
<section tagcloud large>
    Twitter Bootstrap
    jQuery
    less
    ...
    ...
    Jasmine
</section>
```

If you want to have full controll on the size of each tag, you can do the following:

```html
<section tagcloud>
    <span tagcloud-weight="10">Twitter Bootstrap</span>
    <span tagcloud-weight="3">jQuery</span>
    <span tagcloud-weight="20">less</span>
    <span tagcloud-weight="30">GruntJS</span>
    <span tagcloud-weight="50">GulpJS</span>
    <span tagcloud-weight="15">Markdown</span>
    <span tagcloud-weight="20">Jasmins</span>
    <span tagcloud-weight="40">Mocha</span>
    <span>Markdown</span>
</section>
```

## CSS

I personally like a little bit more space between the items of the tag-cloud, so I added


```css
/*********************************************
 * TAGCLOUD
 *********************************************/
span.clouditem {
  padding-left: 0.15em;
  padding-right: 0.15em;
  line-height: 90%;
}
```

to my template CSS
